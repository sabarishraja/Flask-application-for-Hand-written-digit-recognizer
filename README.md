# Handwritten Digit Recognizer (MNIST)
## Overview

This project is a Flask-based web application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits. Users can upload an image of a handwritten digit, and the app will predict the digit using the trained model.
