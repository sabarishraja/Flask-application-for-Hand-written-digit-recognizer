# Handwritten Digit Recognizer (MNIST)
## Overview

This project is a Flask-based web application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits. Users can upload an image of a handwritten digit, and the app will predict the digit using the trained model.

With the basic convolutional neural network, the predicted numbers were not same as the true value.
Here are the test cases that I had used:
